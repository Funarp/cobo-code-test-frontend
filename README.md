## How to submit your code
1. fork this repo under your github account
2. finish the code test
3. send us your repo :)

## Subject
please check the `index.html` in the repo as a sample maze and finish the following tasks:

1. create the maze and put a 'mouse' into the entrance of the maze and you can use `left, right, up, down` key in the keyboard to control it (the mouse can't go across the wall)

2. write the code to find the right path in the maze automatically and add the animation when finding the path

These two tasks are indepentant, please submit your answer separately.

we prefer you use `react` and related tech stack like `redux` to finish these two tasks but you can also choose whatever framework you like.
